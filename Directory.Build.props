      NOTE: Please DO NOT ADD properties that are required for the sample projects.

      Sample projects should be self-contained, such that they can be copied out of the repo and run in isolation.
      Properties specified here relate to analyzers and are intended to maintain code consistency in the Semantic Kernel repo.
      Properties such as LangVersion, Nullable, TargetFramework should be specified in each project's .csproj file.
